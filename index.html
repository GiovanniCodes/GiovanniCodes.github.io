                    <p>
                        Giovanni Gaspard is a sophomore computer engineering major and attends the Miami Dade Honors Program. Giovanni remains involved with his peers by offering math assistance in the Math Lab. His diligence and organizational skills are a major contributor to his success inside and outside the classroom. By being a STEM Ambassador, Giovanni actively engages in campus activities and represent Miami Dade College and STEM with significant honor. He also received certification to become a Graphic Design assistant. Furthermore, he is a part of Phi Theta Kappa due to his outstanding grades.

                    <p>
                        Giovanni remains passionate and driven towards his goals and nothing will deter him from that. He took part in STEM FYE Research during the summer of 2015 and took first place for his studies on the usefulness of the bioluminescence of E Coli. During the summer of 2016, he took part in the School of Science Research internship on Human Interactions with Robotics. He received the President’s Volunteer award for registering more than 200 hours of volunteer service. Giovanni also has become a member of the Urban Paradise Guild. Urban Paradise is a platform used to bring agriculture to rural areas. We go to different communities and cultivate the land for seeding. The plan is to send seeds to Haiti for planting each year. He has become a member of the Florida Engineering Society. It is a hub for engineering, it’s a place that will establish a way to network beyond just school.

                        As a first generation student, Giovanni remains eager to reach the goals that he set for himself. Attending the Honors program, he realized that he is an investment for the future. Statistically, even though yearly it increases, the number of African-Americans that attend college still remains rather low. However, he has made a goal to help further improve that statistic for the future generations.
